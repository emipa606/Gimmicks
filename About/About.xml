--- Original Description ---
&lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#199a35&gt;Gimmicks&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
Contains an item collection with stat boni and modifiers to help your colonists on their menial everyday tasks.
 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#9AB973&gt;Content&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
Around 18 items and a workbench, which includes recipes by supported mods. All tools are automatically categorized by patch and findable under &lt;i&gt;Weapons &gt; Tools&lt;/i&gt; in the storage. Your technological stage matters (Skill too). 

 - Crafting Table with all crossover mod recipes
 - Traders only: Interstellar Encyclopedia, How To, Coupon Book, Flowers
 - Forged #1: Screwdriver, Sickle, Scissors, Whistle
 - Forged #2: Chef's Knife, Skinning Knife, Saw, Shovel
 - Tailored: Pillow
 - Crafted: Whip, Fan (early)
 - Mechanics: Power Drill, Skill Saw
 - Fabricated: Laptop, Smartphone (late)

&lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#FFFF99&gt;Tools&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
This mod introduces several useful tools for your pawns to craft, trade and utilize. They help out with some of the menial tasks your pawns are going to face - construction, plantwork, animals or even research. Most additions are available early on, a few goodies though, are only available on the market, so keep an eye out for them. 

 - Interstellar Encyclopedia (+33% ResearchSpeed)
 - Coupon Book (+25% Bargains)
 - How To (+33% Learning)
 - Laptop (+25% Research, +10% Learning)
 - Smartphone (+20% Workspeed, +10% Learning, -25% Stealth)
 - Skill Saw (2x Treefelling, -25% Yield, Fast, AP)
 - Power Drill  (+33% Constructions, +50% Efficiency, AP)
 - Screwdriver (+25% Repair, +10% Workspeed)
 - Scissors (+33% Tailoring)
 - Whistle (+50% Training) 
 - Lash (+50% Taming)

 - Bouquet (+30% Social Impact, +10% Recruitment)
 - Pillow (-5% Mental Breakdowns, -%25 Sleep)
 - Fan (+10 Cooling)

Remember tools are weapons! They're sharp and heavy. Even a pillow can kill someone with enough effort. We take no responsibility for destroyed colonies, given that no one wants to wear a gun anymore, because of this tool extension.

&lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#C970DB&gt;Patches&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
 - Vanilla Weapons Expanded (Workbench &amp; Recategorization, Whip: +5 Mood)
 - Dead Goat's Weapon Pack (Deadman's Scythe +25% Plants, +10% Yield)
 - Dead Goat's Weapon Pack (Butcher's Cleaver: +33% Butchering, +10% Cooking)
 - Right Tool Rebalanced (Adjustments &amp; Recategorization)
 - [XND] Survival Tools (Recategorization)

Patches in handy stats on "Cleaver" and Scythe" when DGWP is installed or takes care of your tool organization.

&lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#7083DB&gt;Compatibility &amp; Loadorder&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
Load Gimmicks late in the list, especially behind listed or similiar mods.
